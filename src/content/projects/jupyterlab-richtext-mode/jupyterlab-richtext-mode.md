learned: "This was my first work experience with React and TypeScript, and my first time working with a large, open-source codebase implemented with software development 
patterns that I'd never heard of, like factories. I learned how to create a rich text editor with ProseMirror and integrate that with React, albeit the React code wasn't 
the most performant, it was an experience meant for growth and left me wanting to learn more. Also, I learned to work closely alongisde a UI/UX designer, whether it be
collaboratively conducting user research or bouncing ideas off each other."

An extension for JupyterLab that transforms Markdown cells into rich text-editing cells. The editor for these cells
includes standard formatting options that are capable within Markdown such as bold, italic, and underline, while providing support 
for non-standard Markdown features like syntax highlighting for code blocks and the insertion of math equations.
