Working at Project Jupyter was a lot of firsts for me. This was my first work experience with React and TypeScript, 
and my first time working with a large, open-source codebase implemented with software development patterns that I'd never heard of, like factories.
I learned to work closely alongisde a UI/UX designer, whether it be collaboratively conducting user research or bouncing ideas off each other.
